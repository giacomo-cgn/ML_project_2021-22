 **Introduction**

 Our goal was to create from scratch an Artificial Neural Network able
 to solve both classification and regression problems. Although it
 works on different datasets, in our case it was tested on the monk
 problem and ML course's CUP. The objective of this project is to
 find the best configurations of our Neural Network for both of these
 problems. We implemented the building, training, K-fold cross
 validation and testing of a feed-forward Neural Network (with momentum
 and L2 regularization) using back-propagation. The algorithm is able
 to run on on-line, mini-batch and batch configurations and perform
 grid-search to find the best set of hyper-parameters, i.e. with a low
 and smooth loss curve. As extensions, we coded the linear learning
 rate decay, L1 regularization, the possibility to have an arbitrary
 number of hidden layers and also the option to pursue a randomized
 Neural Network and ensemble approach.
